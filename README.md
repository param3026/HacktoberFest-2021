5. Commit, push, and open a Pull Request

Full instructions are below.

## 📏 Rules & quality expectations

Please follow these to keep the project useful for learners:

1. **Place files in the correct language folder.** See the folder list below.
2. **File naming:** be descriptive and unique. Example: `binary_search_python.py` or `linked_list.cpp`.
3. **Small, meaningful PRs only.** Large dumps or archive uploads will be closed.
4. **Add comments** explaining logic and expected input/output where applicable.
5. **No plagiarized or copy‑pasted entire repo content** from other large projects.
6. **No single-line PRs** that add no value (these will be marked invalid).
7. **Include a short explanation** in your PR description: what you added and why.
8. **Follow basic style** for the language (PEP8 for Python, reasonable formatting for C/C++/Java, etc.)

If a PR does not meet these guidelines a reviewer will request changes or close it as invalid.

## 🗂 Folder structure & naming conventions

Suggested structure (create missing folders as needed):

```
HacktoberFest-2021/
├─ C++/
├─ Python/
├─ Java/
├─ JavaScript/
├─ Web-Development/
├─ Algorithms/
├─ Data-Structures/
└─ README.md
```

Naming conventions:

* `problemname_language.extension` → `fibonacci_python.py`
* If multiple files needed (input/test) add a short suffix: `merge_sort_cpp.cpp`, `merge_sort_cpp_test.cpp`

Folder purpose guidance:

* **Algorithms/** — language-agnostic algorithm explanations and pseudocode
* **Data-Structures/** — implementations of classic data structures
* **Web-Development/** — small web-page projects or examples

## ✅ How to open a Pull Request (detailed)

1. **Fork** the repo (top-right of the repo page)
2. **Clone** your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/HacktoberFest-2021.git
cd HacktoberFest-2021
```

3. **Create a feature branch** (never commit directly to `master`/`main`):

```bash
git checkout -b feat/add-<short-description>
```

4. **Add your file** in the correct folder. Include comments and a short example of usage (input / output) in the file header or as README changes.

5. **Stage, commit, push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add <program-name> in <language> - <short description>"
git push origin feat/add-<short-description>
```

6. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork → this repository. Use a helpful PR title and fill the description with:

* What the code does
* Example usage and sample input/output
* Any dependencies or runtime requirements

7. **Wait for review.** A maintainer or reviewer may suggest changes. Please respond politely and update your PR.
